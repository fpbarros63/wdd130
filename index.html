            Hello! My name is Francisco de Paula Barros and I am from Recife, Brazil.
            I have a lovely wife, I have four beauty dougthers that I love so much. I enjoy 
            coding, exploring new technologies, and traveling around the world in my free 
            time. I also love music, playing the guitar and reading books about history. 
            I'm currently trying to learn to play the piano. I'm very excited about this 
            possibility. I hope to play with confidence one day.

        <img src="image/visaopanoramica.webp" alt="Recife, capital of Pernambuco, Brazil" width="200">
        <p>"Recife is the capital of the state of Pernambuco, located in the Northeast region of Brazil.
            The city was founded on March 12, 1537. From the 16th century onwards, it was under Dutch rule for a 
            period of time, during which time there was an intense process of occupation and urbanization.            
            Recife has a humid tropical climate and a relief that varies from flat to gently undulating. 
            It is located in the Atlantic Forest biome. Because of the rivers that cross the city and its 
            bridges, it has been nicknamed the Brazilian Venice.            
            This is where I live and I love this city." - https://brasilescola.uol.com.br/brasil/recife.htm</p>
