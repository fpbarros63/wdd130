        <p>
            Hello! My name is Francisco de Paula Barros and I am from Recife, Brazil.
            I have a lovely wife, I have four beauty dougthers that I love so much. I am 
            living the best phase of my life, with all my children grown up, married and 
            independent. So far I have eight grandchildren who I love very much. 
            I enjoy coding, exploring new technologies, and traveling around the world in
            my free time. I also love music, playing the guitar and reading books about 
            history. I'm currently trying to learn to play the piano. I'm very excited 
            about this possibility. I hope to play with confidence one day.
        </p>

        <h2>Recife</h2>
        <img src="image/visaopanoramica.webp" alt="Recife, capital of Pernambuco, Brazil" width="200">
        <p>"Recife is the capital of the state of Pernambuco, located in the Northeast region of Brazil.
            The city was founded on March 12, 1537. From the 16th century onwards, it was under Dutch rule for a 
            period of time, during which time there was an intense process of occupation and urbanization.            
            Recife has a humid tropical climate and a relief that varies from flat to gently undulating. 
            It is located in the Atlantic Forest biome. Because of the rivers that cross the city and its 
            bridges, it has been nicknamed the Brazilian Venice.            
            This is where I live and I love this city." - https://brasilescola.uol.com.br/brasil/recife.htm</p>
